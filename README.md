# GifTastic
Responsive GIF site (Sports Themed).
Users will be able to look at a page of GIFS depending on the topic. 
Users will be able to click to start the GIF or click once again to stop the GIF.


Added JS allows users to add a new athlete via textbox and Submit button. Clicking any of the athlete buttons will produce a page of GIFs.

NOT FINISHED: Errors still include not being able to pause/play the GIFs (document.on function and click functions were made but both do not work)
